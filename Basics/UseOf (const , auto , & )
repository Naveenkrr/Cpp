Using const auto& in a range-based for loop is a common practice in C++ for iterating over elements of a container when you don't need to modify the elements. 

Here's a breakdown of each part:

## const
This indicates that the elements are constant and cannot be modified inside the loop. 
It ensures that you don't accidentally change the elements while iterating over them, which can be helpful for preventing bugs and ensuring code clarity.

## auto: 
This is used to automatically deduce the type of the elements. It allows you to avoid explicitly specifying the type, which can make the code more concise and easier to read.

## &: 
This is used to capture the elements by reference. It avoids making a copy of each element, which can be more efficient, especially for large or complex objects.

You should use const auto& when you only need to access the elements and you don't intend to modify them. 
If you do need to modify the elements, you can use auto& without the const.
